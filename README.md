# Born2beRoot - 42 Project

**Born2beRoot's** objective is to configure a virtual machine with a Linux distribution of your choice (Debian) and set up a series of essential services and configurations. 

This includes installing and configuring a web server, managing users and permissions, and setting up a working environment that mimics a real-world server setup.

## Mandatory Part:
- **Virtual Machine Setup**: Debian installed on a virtual machine (Virtual Box as hypervisor)
- **System Configuration**: Install and configure `sudo`, user and group management, `SSH` setup, and `UFW` 
- **Security and Permissions**: Configure `sudo` policies, enforce a strong password policy, and change the default SSH port for enhanced security
- **Monitoring.sh Script**: Create a script (`monitoring.sh`) to display information on all terminals every 10 minutes using `crontab`.
